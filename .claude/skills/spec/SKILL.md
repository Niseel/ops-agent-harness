# Requirements & design

Read the attached intent file: $ARGUMENTS

1. Load any policy skills available (security, brand, UX, compliance).
2. Produce a requirements + design spec that the engineering team can plan against.
3. Clearly flag areas of concern, especially where policies conflict.
4. Write it to specs/<slug>.md using specs/_TEMPLATE.md, alongside the intent.
5. Summarize and tell the user the next step is /feature specs/<slug>.md.

Do not write code here. This stage only produces spec.md.
